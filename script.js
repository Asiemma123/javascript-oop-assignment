// Write a Car class in Javascript that has the following properties:
// 1. Make
// 2. Model
// 3. Year
// 4. Color
// Finally, make sure to add 4 methods (getMake, getModel, getYear, and getColor) that return the car's respective properties
// (This is called a 'getter' in Object Oriented Programming)

//If you're stuck, take a look at the example class here for reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-object-oriented-programming-javascript/#
